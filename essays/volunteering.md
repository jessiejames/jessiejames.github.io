## *It's Easy to See That Time is Money* 
# So why not see volunteering as an investment!

<br> 
In some ways, I've been a volunteer junkie my whole life. Whether it was getting myself involved in club leadership positions or signing my weekends away, I have always found someway to be helping in a million activities that I'm not getting paid for.

However, as time has progressed, I have decided that some of my best professional decisions were to volunteer. Now I'm not going to talk about the butterfly stories and sugar coated reasons that your high school counserlors told you: *"you'll make friends, you'll feel good about helping someone, you'll make the world a better place"*. The reasons I'll present are strictly career oriented. 

## 1. You'll Learn What You Like
When entering the realm of tech, there are soooo many niches that you can work in: cybersecurity, embedded systems, front end, back end, dev ops, big data, AI, AR, VR, IoT, and the list goes on. There is NO way that you will have enough time to take courses on each of these subjects. Of course there are free online tutorials, but is that what *working* in that field is like. Why not volunteer for something that you're interested in. If there's a hackathon based on one of these topics, and you're really interested, but your imposter syndrome won't let you sign up. Or you just don't have time to dedicate all weekend, but you have maybe a few hours to spare: <b>try volunteering to help at the <insert interest> hackathon!<b>
