## *It's Easy to See That Time is Money*
# SO WHY NOT SEE VOLUNTEERING AS AN INVESTMENT?

<br> 
<img class="ui medium left floated rounded image" src="../images/volunteer_tribute.jpg">
In some ways, I've been a volunteer junkie my whole life. Whether it was getting myself involved in club leadership positions or signing my weekends away, I have always found someway to be helping in a million activities that I'm not getting paid for. However, as time has progressed, I have decided that some of my best professional decisions were my volunteer experiences. Now I'm not going to talk about the butterfly stories and sugar coated reasons that your high school counserlors told you: *"you'll make friends, you'll feel good about helping someone, you'll make the world a better place"*. The reasons I'll present are strictly career oriented.

Have you ever tried really hard to make a team or pass a test and your skills just didn’t cut it? Everyone has experienced the feeling of “not being good enough”. Sometimes this is for good reason: you shouldn’t pass a driving test, if you prove that you know the laws of the road and how to operate a vehicle accordingly. Other times, however, you feel like you were being underestimated or even judged for reasons that were trivial or even pompous. The worst example would be something similar to those teeny bop movies with the bullying scenes where you “weren’t cool enough” to sit at that lunch table.

## 1.1 You'll Learn What You Don't Like
This just follows up on the idea above, but can be as equally as important. What if you dedicated a whole 6 month course to a topic you found out you just weren't as interested in as you thought. Or what if you are too far into a new project you were trying out? You don't want to give up and hurt your credibility, but you've discovered that you are not passionate about the subject. We've all been through this, but sometimes volunteering for a project of this flavor is an easier way to pass up this unfortunate circumstance.  

Personal Experience: I'm not interested in Minecraft after helping kids learn to code in it.

## 2.0 Fun Group Projects
Almost every interviewer wants to know the details on the group projects you've worked on. But it's hard to get a long list of big group projects on your resume before graduating. *Have no fear, volunteering is here!* If you don't have the time to sign on to a big group project, try looking for a short term, big group volunteer opportunity. Maybe a weekend clean up crew or workshop activity to help in. Anything that shows that you worked with others and participated in planning and separating tasks will look great to an employer. Plus, it will help you learn what group position you feel most comfortable in. Do you like taking the lead in decisions or would you rather help out with what needs to get done. 

Personal Experience: I enjoyed so many projects that I did through the local hackerspace (HiCapacity). Everyone comes from such different backgrounds that there is always someone that will teach you something you don't know. Also shoutout to the Transpiler project team. I'm learning so much from everyone. We're all on different levels, but everyone is humble about it, and keeping up with the pace.

## 2.1 Awkward Group Projects
<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/volunteer_bad_group.png">

Similar to 1.1, this follows up on 2.0. A very important story that interviewers look for is how you handled an awkward or even miserable group experience. Wheter it was a bad egg on the team or a misunderstanding of responsibilities, bad group experiences are important lessons that everyone must go through to prepare them for the future. Why? Because it will never go away. That's right, even as adolecents become adults, these awkward situations pop up in the workplace and an employer wants to know that you won't go postal or give up just because the team isn't working well together. So by volunteering, you get a chance to test the waters, and if the group experience is bad, at least it doesn't affect your grade, or worse, your paycheck. You can also test out different methods to solve these issues like talking about it with a mentor, or just confronting the person straight on. These decisions might be more risky in a work or class setting, but as a volunteer, you won't feel as worried to test the waters. 

Personal Experience: I went through a really tough, year long, group project once. I learned that regardless of the outcome, if the bad vibe starts disturbing progress & talking in the group isn't helping, it's best to talk to a mentor. Otherwise the mentor won't know until it's too late and then everyone looks bad.

## 3.0 Networking
If you don't already know the merit in networking, then I wish you luck on all of your future endeavors. I, however, have seen networking to be the primary first foot in the door for many job positions. This is why I really like volunteering for community tech events.

<img class="ui medium left floated rounded image" src="../images/volunteer_networking.jpg">

School led tech events are great, but they usually are primarily made up of student volunteers who are all at the same experience level. Volunteering for community events allows you to network with individuals who are working in the industry. These connections could turn into great reference letters, recommendations, or just general insight to gain about working in the industry at a certain location. Maybe you'll find out about a company that you hadn't heard of or a position that is opening up somewhere soon. You never know whose hand your shaking. 

Personal Experience: I got my first internship through a voluntary school project. Then I got my next internship, by volunteering for outreach events at the first internship. 

## 4.0 Ok I Lied, Everything Your Counselor Said Actually is True & Important
<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/volunteer_elf.jpeg">

The making friends, feeling good about yourself, and help make the world a better place are actually all true. Something I had underestimated from joining all of the clubs I'm involved in at school is that I have made so many friends. It's so nice when I start a new semester and I recognize a familiar face from HKN in my classes. Or when I notice that my IEEE buddy is always heading to Starbucks the same time I am. I have met all of these people through numerous outreach events. During volunteer events you usually have some downtime to socialize a little and find out more about someone than how they did on last weeks quiz. And studies show that we as social creatures, need these bonds to be a more mentally stable, and thus, productive.  

Now the feel good about yourself part should be a given. No matter how small the task, if you weren't there to do it, it means that someone else would have needed to do it, or it would not have gotten done. Sometimes even little gestures can make a big difference. So you should feel good for helping make someone's life a little easier, which in the end, will <b>make the world a better place</b>. 

Personal Experience: [This Article](https://kapionews.kapiolani.hawaii.edu/techie-treats-highlight-haunted-hack-night/)  about Haunted Hack Night gave me all the feels. It was a workshop I put together to help spread the word about the tech resources we had at KCC and in the community. 

# Invest in Your Career By Volunteering! 



Well that’s about what programming with a style inspector is like. I’ve recently been trying out the IntelliJ IDE used with the ESLint style inspector and interpreter for a JavaScript assignment. Honestly, it can feel a little disheartening when you put your program out there to compile, knowing it will work, only to feel the shade from the eyes of the compiler as it becomes your harshest critic. The screen fills with red lines screaming “not good enough”. In the beginning this was really frustrating to deal with. After a little googling, I was able to find the ESLint documentation though. That really helped me narrow down the correct syntax that would solve my errors and stop the “sass” from IntelliJ. 

I have to say that my post-perspective is much more grateful than my in-the-moment reception. Despite all of the frustration, about half of the errors that the debugger caught were in part due to my coding malpractice. In this way, using the inspector has already helped me improve my coding practices. Another benefit of using this coding standard is that it will make my code more readable. It would be hard to use a map app if one interface for one city was totally different from another. 
	
This is exactly the problem that coding standardization tries to solve. It’s laying out an agreed upon style for their programs so that when a third party is looking at the code, they can easily understand or find what they are looking for. Standardization in general can seem a little over centralized, but anarchy usually leads to chaos and less productivity. This is why implementing coding standards in your IDE helps you improve your skills and always stick to the same template for organizing your code. Overall, the best way I can think to describe using the ESLint inspector is basically like putting a big Gandalf between your code and the actual compiler that will check whether or not your syntax style shall pass.
