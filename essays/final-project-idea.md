# Overview 
Explorers of the internet of today would drown without a guide. Sometimes it seems like there is just *too much* information out there. To solve this we are proposing an app with insight from a community that you trust to guide your way. This app would allow university sub groups that specialize in an area to post their suggestions for the bare minimum information a newbie needs to get started in that area. We think a great name for this would be the "Bow Warrior Basics". This site will give pages to each organization on campus. Examples in CS would be artificial intelligence or security. More importantly to 314 students though are the groups outside of CS such as microbiology or renaissance history. These pages would be all formatted the same so that the information is presented in a familiar way everytime.

# Mockup page ideas
 A quick mockup of the page would organize the site menu by majors, and further by sub groups. Each subgroups' pages would have a table or list of the top things a beginner should focus on. These items will have a small limit of 150 words for example. Thus, if their tips are too big, they will be restricted to link a seperate site that they recommend.

# Use case ideas
A use case would be any time a student wants to work on a project and include a feature that involves knowledge from a different discipline. For example, you're a CS student and you want to make an app about recycling, but you don't even know how that is handled on island or on campus. Instead of drowning in the internet for info, you can find tips from a renewable resource group on campus.

# Beyond the basics
 Extra features would be that you can have a social aspect to this. There could be a comment style page where you shout out your organization and how you're using the app and other information from a seperate group.
