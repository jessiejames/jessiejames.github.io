<b> Scope </b><br/>
The scope of this project was to design and build a device that would compliment a cosplay piece for the Amazing Hawaii Comic Con under a three week time frame. The pitch of this project came about because a member of HiCapacity who was asked to do a panel at cosplay, could no longer make the event. So this was a last minute, time to show what you've got, sort of project which added to the excitement of it all in the end. Now HiCapacity is a local hackerspace in Honolulu where I happened to be doing my summer internship. So I was very lucky to have access to members of the community from all different backgrounds. From fine arts, electrical engineering, computer science and even molecular biology, the skill support I had on this project really gave me the confidence that I could complete it in time.

So the first step was to think of a costume. I really like the style that Storm from the X-men always had: the contrasting look from the silver white hair, the dark clothes and complexion, and of course the blueish white eyes. Also the fact that the energy she could summon was primarily electrical energy fit the scope of the project very nicely. Most cosplayers that portray Storm will typically wear white contacts to show this effect. The problem with this is that Storm's eyes were not always white. They turned white when she was summoning a storm.
