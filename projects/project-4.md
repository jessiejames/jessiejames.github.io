CanSat is a NASA sponsored event in which teams worldwide compete to simulate a Mars payload descending, recording and transmitting atmospheric measurements to be submitted to a ground station. The focus of this competition is to recreate the engineering research and design process that makes a Mars landing project possible. There are several design limitations that each team must meet in order to compete. The payload's design is restricted by a number of factors such as limits on mass, flight path, cost, and durability. These factors heavily influence the electronics that may be used for data collection based on the size, power, and communication limitations. Aside from constructing the payload, each team must present several preliminary designs to a NASA engineer for review before the payload launch in Texas.

During this project, I was primarily responsible for programming the sensor integration and flight logic as well as designing the release mechanism for our payload from it's safety cannister. The components for our system included:
<ul>
  <li> Arduino Pro Mini </li>
  <li> Barometric Pressure Sensor </b></li>
  <li> GPS Location Sensor </li>
  <li> Real Time Clock </li>
  <li> Temperature Sensor </li>
  <li> Pitot Tube Speed Sensor </li>
  <li> SD card reader </li>
  <li> XBee Radio </li>
</ul>
